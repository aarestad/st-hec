that sounds right, but just to clarify, i'll give you my explanation, and
you can see if it matches what you're thinking...

after the data for each frame is read in, the bits for each tile in the 
image are sent to the appropriate node in the viz cluster.  each viz node
saves the data that it receives (i.e. tile N for each frame of the movie)
into a single movie file.  (actually i'll need to do some work to modify
this at some point, to accomidate movies that are >2GB, by putting them
into multiple files, but you get the idea).

sure, i'd be interested in seeing any changes that you make, assuming that
they make it faster :)

thanks,
