Rob,

In the case of Joe's app the goal is to be able to stage data to a given
tiled display in a reasonable manner from images that are rendered at format
that is reasonable for the given dataset.

In general the goal of the tiled display work is to investigate the use of
commodity based graphics systems to develop parallel and distributed
visualization tools. We are also interested in how different advanced
displays (tiled displays, caves) can be used to accelerate the understanding
of datasets. Finally the amount of information generated by today's
simulations and instruments far surpasses the resolution of today's desktop
systems without subsampling or zooming in. Then of course we have come full
circle with developing for the tiled display we need to develop parallel and
distributed visualization tools.

Mike

P.S. I don't understand the tech, it has something with 0's and 1's but is
very complicated :)

Mike,

Basically I'm going to present a little performance data on Joe Insley's
app, in the context of tuning MPI-IO applications.  I just want to put a
couple of bullets on an introductory slide that say something about why
we're interested in using tiled displays.  I'm not going to push any
particular group's solution or anything like that.

Thanks,

Rob
