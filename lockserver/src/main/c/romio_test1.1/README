6/10/2005 - I have fixed the code to use MPI_TYPE_VECTOR.

2/22/2005 - Make the code much better.  However, it requires that
MPI_Type_struct support MPI_LB and MPI_UB.  I have modified it for
easy operation.

9/5/2002 - added compiler flags to compile for reading and writing so
in between we can clear the caches of the I/O servers.  Note, the
first write and read are simply to load the executable code
(MPI_File_write_all and MPI_File_read_all) into memory.  Interesting.

To run:
mpiexec -n 8 ./coll_perf -write -posix -gsize 10 -filename hi2
