This repository contains code for our work on Hydra (a user-level filesystem) and block/byte-range lock server (a user-level distributed locking framework). This work is related to our [Scalable Technologies for Ultra-scale I/O](http://www.st-hec.info) project, which was supported in part by the National Science Foundation.

## Installing Hydra

The build instructions are available in the Hydra README.txt file, which can also be found in the top-level directory after you perform the repository checkout.

Please contact us if you are interested in working with this code. We have not yet written an installation document but there are proper make files (for the C portion) and Ant build files (for the Java portion). So it is possible to explore on your own.
