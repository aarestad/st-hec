5/18/2005 - Fixed the timing so that the barriers aren't included.

03/11/2005 - I changed the initialization procedures of the blocks.  I have changed the test arguments.  

7/17/2003 - Added the datatype I/O as one more possibility to run the code with.  There is a test_run.sh program to verify that the files are all created the same.  Also, the files generated by flash have slightly different file names that make more sense now.  One thing to note is that an easy test is to scale down the original parameters in the test code to run it faster.  I felt this warranted a simple upgrade to version 1.2. =)

9/5/2002 - fixed the file extent.  Checked with pvfs code and everything is fixed.  Added the collective write hint to the collective one and removed it on listio.

9/4/2002 - delete files beforehand...problem with file extent.

9/3/2002 - Verified that the datatypes are the same in the PVFS test case and the MPI-IO test case.
